Zsync for Android
==================

To compile on Ubuntu 14.04 (not tested on other versions but should be fine):
1) go into zsync-0.6.2
2) sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
3) ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabi CFLAGS="-static"
4) make

result is a binary called "zsync"
just push it to your phone, chmod +x and start using it
